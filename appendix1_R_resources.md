## R communities

A good way to learn R (or anything) is to be a part of a community of experts and learners.
If your institue has an R users group, or similar group, consider joining them.
If your institute does not have this sort of community, consider starting one.
That will make you look like a leader, and will bring help to you.
Other options are to join an online community.
[Open Plant Pathology](https://openplantpathology.org/) has a slack channel where you can ask friendly people questions about R or other plant pathology topics.
Twitter is also a good source for information.
For example, the account @RLangTip will send you one tip per day on how to use R.
